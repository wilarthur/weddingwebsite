                <p>We are getting married at <a href="https://www.thesancroftbarns.co.uk/">The Sancroft Barns</a>, which
                    is in Fressingfield, in North Suffolk.</p>
                <h3>Getting here</h3>
                <p>For those of you coming from Essex, you will need to follow directions towards Bury St Edmunds, until
                    you see signs for Eye. The Sancroft Barns is located just before you reach Eye, in a rural village
                    called Fressingfield.</p>

                <h3>Taxi companies</h3>
                <p>For people who want to get a taxi to a local place to stay, we reccomend booking them now. You can
                    get taxis from Diss, Eye or Ipswich, but they must be booked in advance due to the location of the
                    venue.</p>
                <h3>Places to stay</h3>
                <p>For places to stay, we reccomend looking at Airbnb as there are quite a few small cottages locally.

                <h4>Can I bring a plus one?</h4>
                <p>We are trying to keep our wedding to our close friends and family, so we don't have plus one's as

                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>Thank you so much for choosing to spend our special day with us. We absolutely cannot wait to
                    celebrate our love with
                    our closest friends and family.</p>

                <p>We have had a pretty crazy journey so far and we thought we would take you on a trip down memory lane
                    and tell you about
                    our story leading up to becoming a married couple…</p>

                <p>It all started in secondary school, when Erin, who spent most of her days dreaming of meeting
                    someone, getting married
                    and raising a family, started noticing this cute guy with floppy brown hair in the other half of the
                    year. She always
                    knew of him, but didn’t really think of him like that. One day she went on a school prefect trip and
                    heard more about
                    this boy she liked (who was not a prefect, but Erin liked the idea of a bad boy).</p>

                <p>As she watched him in the playground every lunch time, she thought more about the boy until one day
                    she plucked up the
                    courage to message him. It started with a simple “hey x” to which he replied “hey :)” and as they
                    say the rest is
                    history…</p>

                <p>They continued to message one another other constantly, sometimes staying up until 3am just getting
                    to know each other,
                    just 4 days later Wil decided (well was pretty much forced by Erin’s friends) to ask Erin to be his
                    girlfriend.</p>

                <p>They went on their first date, a trip to the movies and Wil stayed with Erin until her bus came. This
                    meant he missed
                    the only bus for himself, so his mum had to come and pick him up, in that moment Erin knew he was
                    the kind of boy she
                    wanted to be with.</p>

                <p>They continued to meet up, but Erin was so nervous about the whole situation she refused kiss him,
                    despite Wil trying on
                    multiple occasions, including prom night where she rejected him in front of all their friends. Their
                    first kiss finally
                    came 3 months later, poor Wil!</p>

                <p>They started college together and soon realised that they were so madly in love, as all teenagers
                    think they are, that
                    they wanted to spend every waking moment together. They would get the bus together, meet up between
                    classes, go to lunch
                    together, meet each other after college. They just couldn’t get enough of being with one another.
                </p>

                <p>They spent the next year working on themselves, as teenagers they didn’t really know what they wanted
                    in life but knew
                    they wanted to face it together. They went to another college and ended up meeting some of their
                    best friends, who are
                    actually now in their wedding party and half of their guests… shout out to the “dimstitute” gang!
                    They turned 18, went
                    to way too many house parties, had a few too many drunken nights out and made a load of awesome
                    memories, which they
                    will cherish forever.</p>

                <p>Both of them started working full time and now that Erin could drive it made meeting up a lot easier,
                    this however meant
                    they actually did spend every waking moment together. Wil became quite poorly, having been diagnosed
                    with cancer, but
                    Erin was with him every step of the way and was the one holding his hand when the news got broken to
                    them.</p>

                <p>Becoming poorly put life and love into perspective for them both and in that moment they realised
                    life
                    was so short,
                    they couldn’t face not being together. At just 20 years old, they decided to put the small amount of
                    savings they had
                    into moving out together into their first home.</p>

                <p>Soon after, Covid hit and they were faced with being a young couple with absolutely no money in the
                    middle of a
                    pandemic. Lots of at home date nights, panic shops, FaceTiming with friends and family, along with
                    Erin
                    creating a mini
                    nightclub in the house for Wil’s 21st, meant they made it through just fine.</p>

                <p>They welcomed their first addition to the family, their beautiful cat Lola. She was a funny little
                    madam, who took a
                    real shining to Wil, probably due to his calm, caring nature and a real disliking to Erin, probably
                    because of her
                    chaotic, loud energy.</p>

                <p>They spent the few years falling even more madly in love, they absolutely adored each other and
                    enjoyed
                    spending time
                    and making unforgettable memories with their wonderful families and friends. They hosted some
                    awesome
                    house parties,
                    spent time outdoors, went on beautiful holidays and made even more wonderful friends.</p>

                <p>One day Erin thought she was going for lunch with her mum, a pub lunch so nothing special, she
                    decided
                    to not bother
                    having a shower or washing she hair. As they were driving, her mum told her that her dad, a
                    mechanic,
                    had left some
                    tools at a local farmhouse and they needed to go and collect them for him. Erin was very confused
                    when
                    they got there,
                    as she knocked on the door and the owner had no clue what they were talking about. She turned around
                    and
                    noticed Wil’s
                    car and suddenly it started to sink in what was happening. She walked round to a small converted
                    barn
                    and saw it
                    completely decorated, with Wil in a shirt waiting for her. She walked in and he gave a beautiful
                    speech
                    before getting
                    down on one knee and asking the question she had always dreamed of him asking. They spent the day
                    and
                    evening talking
                    about the planning that went into it, telling all their family and friends, eating a delicious
                    homemade
                    meal and slow
                    dancing the night away to cheesy classics. They spent the next few days in a bubble, going to
                    Cambridge
                    to celebrate and
                    taking as many opportunities as possible to show off that beautiful ring.</p>

                <p>Wil told Erin all about how he told her parents. Erin had been very clear on the fact he didn’t have
                    to
                    ask permission,
                    so he sat them down and said “I’m not asking you, I’m telling you that I am going to ask Erin to
                    marry
                    me” they were
                    over the moon, he showed them the ring and told his family about it also.</p>

                <p>Soon came the wedding planning, they went to different venues, chose their special date, saved their
                    money harder than
                    ever, ate lots of delicious food, had meetings with different vendors. In amongst all that, they
                    knew
                    they had to throw
                    the most important house party of all, since they were known for it! They hosted their engagement
                    party,
                    70 people in
                    their 2 bed semi garden, on one of the hottest days of the year and they agreed, it was the best day
                    of
                    their lives so
                    far. A small taster of what the wedding would be like and they honestly couldn’t thank their friends
                    and
                    family enough
                    for all the love they received.</p>

                <p>They decided to add to the madness by getting their puppy, Ned, less than a year before getting
                    married.
                    They knew they
                    were crazy, but they enjoyed the chaos and they knew in the long run the stress would be worth it…
                    Somehow the craziness
                    didn’t stop there because less than 6 months before getting married, cat and dog in tow, they
                    decided to
                    move homes over
                    Christmas. They were the sort of couple who thrived on everything being spontaneous and what better
                    way
                    to test that
                    than to spend the whole of December sleeping on the sofa, planning a wedding, preparing for
                    Christmas,
                    training a puppy
                    and trying to pack away everything they owned.</p>

                <p>That brings us to present day, we are now living in our beautiful home, we have our wonderful pets,
                    planning the wedding
                    of our dreams and we can’t wait to celebrate with you all soon.</p>

                <p>Thanks so much for reading our story, we hope it gives you a better insight into us and you can’t
                    wait
                    to celebrate our
                    special day with us!</p>
